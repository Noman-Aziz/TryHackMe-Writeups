_K8 is an open source container orchestration tool developed by Google which helps you manage containerized applications in different deployment environments like physical, virtual, cloud or hybrid etc._

## **Description**

Series: Kubernetes - 101

Part 1 : Components

Reference : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X48VuDVv0do

## **Details**

### Pod

- Smallest unit of K8s
- Abstraction over container
- Usually 1 application per Pod
- Each Pod gets its own IP address
- New IP address on re-creation
  - E.g, DB dies and new DB is created which will get new IP address

### Service & Ingress

- Permenant IP address
  - Can be attached to each pod
- Lifecycle of Pod and Service are not connected
  - If Pod dies then service and its ip remains

#### External Service

- Service which is accessible externally using url
- Format of url is http://ip:port

#### Internal Service

- Service which should not be accessible externally
- Have same format of url http://ip:port

#### Ingress

- Solves the problem of having static ip, port and protocol assigned to external services
- Assigns a domain name and certificate to requests
- Acts as a reverse proxy

### ConfigMap & Secret

#### ConfigMap

##### Problem

- Suppose DB url was configured inside my-app and its image was built and pushed to dockerhub
- Now, the DB url gets changed and image must be modified, rebuilt and pushed to dockerhub then pulled into pod and restart

##### Solution

- Thats where **ConfigMap** comes in, we can store such external configuration of our app and attach it to the pod

#### Secret

- Works to solve similar problem as ConfigMap
- ConfigMap stores configuration in plain text format so it should not be used to store secrets such as username, passwords, etc
- Secret should be used instead
- Things are stored in base64 encoded format
- Built in security mechanism is not enabled by default

### Volumes

- Used for data storage, same concept as docker since k8s does not manage data persistance
- Storage can be on **local** machine or **remote** storage outside of k8s cluster

## Deployment & StatefulSet

#### Deployment (Replication)

- Solves the problem of single point of failure
  - In case Pod dies
- We replication everything on another node for fault tolerance or load balancer
- Replica is connected to same service
- We don't create another pod but define **blueprint** for pods
- It is an abstraction layer on top of pods.
- In practice deployment is used instead of pods.
- **DBs can't be replicated via deployment**
  - Because database has a state
  - To avoid data inconsistencies
- **Should be used for StateLess apps**

#### StatefulSet

- Solves the DB replication problem of Deployment
- **Should be used for StateFul apps or Databases**
- Deploying StatefulSet is not easy
- DBs are often hosted outside of K8s cluster
