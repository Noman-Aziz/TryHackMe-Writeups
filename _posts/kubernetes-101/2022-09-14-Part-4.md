## **Description**

Series: Kubernetes - 101

Part 4 : YAML Configuration Files

## **Details**

### Introduction

- Config File is written in YAML Format
- Config File should be stored with the code inside SCM

### 3 Parts of K8 Config File
1. Metadata
2. Specification
3. Status (Auto Generated & Added by K8)
	- K8 Gets Status from etcd

### Template

- The specified **kind** has its own *metadata* and *spec* 
- Pod has also a section of its own which contains its own configuration

#### Labels & Connectors

- *Metadata* section contain the labels
- *Spec* section contains the selectors

##### Connecting Deployment to Pods

- Deployment looks which pods belong to it using labels (key value pairs)
- The label is matched by the selector
