_Part 5 of K8 series contain details about the Kubernetes Namespaces._

<!--more-->

## **Description**

Series: Kubernetes - 101

Part 5 : Namespaces

## **Details**

### Namespace

- Organize resources in namespaces
- Virtual clusters inside k8 cluster
- 4 Namespaces by default
- kubernetes-dashboard only with minikube
 1. kube-system
	 - Do not create or modify in kube-system
	 - Used by system processes
	 - Master or kubectl processes
 2. kube-public
	 - Publically accessible data
	 - A configmap, which contains cluster information
 3. kube-node-lease
	 - heartbeats of nodes
	 - each node has associated lease of object in namespace
	 - determines the availability of node
 4. default
	 - resources you create are located here

### Creating Namespace

#### Using CLI

```
kubectl create namespace <my-namespace>
```

### Using Config File

Add namespace attribute in metadata.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
	name: mysql-configmap
	namespace: my-namespace
data:
	db_utl: mysql-service.database
```

### Why to use namespace

#### 1. Resources goruped in namespace

- All resources are created in default namespace
- Overtime, default namespace will be filled with different components
- Difficult to overview the namespace at that time
- Should not use for smaller projects

#### 2. Conflicts: many teams, same application

- Two teams use same cluster and first team deploy app named my-app, second team also uses same same of deployment, hence they override previous team deployment
- Each team should use their own namespace to avoid disruption

#### 3. Resource Sharing

1. Staging and Deployment
- Reuse the common components in both environments like logging cluster
2. Blue/Green Deployment
- Two different versions of production like v1 and v2
- They may need to use same resources

#### 4. Access and Resource Limits on Namespaces

- We can give Team A access to their own namespace and vice versa
- They can't access other team's namespace
- We can also limit cpu, ram, storage resources per namespace using resource quota

##### Services which can't be accessed from another namespace

Since we cant access most resources from another namespace, simple things like **ConfigMap** and **Secrets** should be regenerated in each namespace causing duplication

##### Services which can be accessed from another namespace

- Service can be accessed from another namespace
- In ConfigMap definitation, the db_url will contains service name along with namespace name

### Components which can't be created within namespace

- Some resources live globally inside a cluster
- you cant isolate them
- Examples are **Volumes** and **Nodes**
- Can be listed by `kubectl api-resources --namespaced=false` and vice versa

### Changing Active Namespace

```
$ yay kubectx
$ kubens
$ kubens my-namespace
```
