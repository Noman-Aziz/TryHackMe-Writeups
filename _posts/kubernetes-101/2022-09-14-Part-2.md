_Part 2 of K8 series contain details about the architecture of Kubernetes._

<!--more-->

## **Description**

Series: Kubernetes - 101

Part 2 : Architecture

## **Details**

### Node Processes

- Each Node has multiple Pods in it
- Worker Nodes do the actual work
- 3 processes must be installed on every Node
	1. **Container Runtime**
		- Docker or other technology
	2. **Kublet**
		- Interacts with both container and node
		- It starts the pod with a container inside
	3. **Kube proxy**
		- Forwards the requests between nodes

### Master Processes

- 4 processes must be installed on every master node which controls cluster state and worker nodes
	1. **API Server**
		- Could be UI, API, CLI, Kubectl) 
		- Acts as cluster gateway
		- Acts as gatekeeper for authentication
	2. **Scheduler**
		- API Server after validation of request hands over the request to scheduler
		- It just decides on which node new pod should be scheduled based on current resources of nodes
		- Kublet is the actual component which does the scheduling after getting request form scheduler
	3. **Controller Manager**
		- Detec cluster state changes like dying of podes
		- It makes a request to scheduler to restart the pod
	4. **etcd**
		- It is the cluster brain
		- cluster changes get stored in the key value store
		- application data is not stored in etcd
- On multiple master nodes
	- API server is load balanced
	- etcd forms distributed storage across all master nodes
